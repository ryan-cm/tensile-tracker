# Tensile Tracker: Real-time Finger Strength Monitoring and Data Visualization Tool
Welcome to the Tensile Tracker repository!

## Project Overview:
At the moment, Tensile Tracker is intended to send finger tension data to your preferred device over bluetooth. The goal is to eventually create a mobile app to plot and track this data.

## Eventual Features:

* **Real-time Tensile Strength Measurement**: Measures and records the tension exerted by the fingers up to 200 kg force.
* **Web Server Integration**: Seamlessly uploads the measured data to a dedicated mobile app for real-time tracking and historical analysis.
* **User-friendly Data Visualization**: Intuitive and detailed graphical representations of tensile strength over time, aiding climbers in tracking their progress.
* **Climber-focused Design**: Specifically tailored for climbers aiming to improve finger strength, offering insights into performance and training effectiveness.

## Getting Started:
Wait for further progress on the code...
