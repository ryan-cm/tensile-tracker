# Tensile Tracker: Real-time Finger Strength Monitoring and Data Visualization Tool
Welcome to the Tensile Tracker repository!

## Project Overview:
At the moment, Tensile Tracker is intended to be simple web server for the Arduino Nano ESP32 for tracking finger strength in real-time. When the development of the AFE becomes satisfactory, that stuff will live here too. Until then, this will be the home for the web server.

## Eventual Features:

**Real-time Tensile Strength Measurement**: Measures and records the tension exerted by the fingers up to 200 kg force.
**Web Server Integration**: Seamlessly uploads the measured data to a dedicated web server for real-time tracking and historical analysis.
**User-friendly Data Visualization**: Intuitive and detailed graphical representations of tensile strength over time, aiding climbers in tracking their progress.
**Climber-focused Design**: Specifically tailored for climbers aiming to improve finger strength, offering insights into performance and training effectiveness.

## Getting Started:
Wait for further progress on the firmware...
